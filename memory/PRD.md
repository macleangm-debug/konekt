## Governance Model

### Core Rule: Orders Created ONLY After Payment Approval

**Fixed-Price Products Flow:**
1. Customer adds products to cart
2. Checkout creates **Invoice** (no order yet)
3. Payment intent created (full or deposit)
4. Customer uploads payment proof (camera/file, no transaction reference)
5. Confirmation modal + single-click protection on submit
6. Finance/Admin reviews proof in Finance Queue
7. **On approval**: Order + Vendor Orders + Sales Assignment + Commissions created
8. On rejection: Invoice reverts to pending, customer can resubmit

**Multi-Service Request Flow:**
1. Customer selects multiple service lines (group + subgroup from taxonomy)
2. Enters shared brief/requirements
3. Submits bundled service request → lead created
4. Sales receives one lead with multiple service lines → prepares quote

**Multi-Promo Customization Flow:**
1. Customer selects multiple blank/promotional items
2. Chooses variants (color, size, quantity) per item
3. Enters one shared customization brief
4. Submits bundled customization request → lead created
5. Sales receives one lead with multiple line items

### Commission Model (Non-Margin-Touching)
- Price is built first: base cost + protected company margin + VAT
- Commission triggered ONLY after approved payment
- Commission calculated from commissionable pool (total amount)
- Affiliate commission: 5% default (configurable via admin)
- Sales commission: 3% default (configurable via admin)
- Both can coexist on same order (configurable)
- Minimum payout threshold: TZS 50,000 (configurable)

### Service Taxonomy (Admin-Managed)
Single source of truth for service groups and subgroups:
- Printing & Branding (9 subgroups)
- Creative & Design (10 subgroups)
- Photography & Videography (10 subgroups)
- Facilities Services (8 subgroups)
- Technical Support (8 subgroups)
- Business Support (6 subgroups)
- Uniforms & Workwear (6 subgroups)
- Promotional Materials (11 subgroups)
